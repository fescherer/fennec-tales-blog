VSCode is one of the most popular IDE's for coding everything from Java to Javascript. VSCode is super customizable and for that the community created a lot of custom extensions for VSCode. That's what we will cover in this article.

## Extensions.json

This is a file you can add to `.vscode` folder and configure a set of extensions that are recommended by VSCode if the user don't have them.

## 1. VSCode Eslint

  name="VSCode Eslint"
  alt="Print showing VSCode Eslint extension"

[As the doc says](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started):

<Blockquote cite="https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started">
Eslint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code
</Blockquote>

This means that its goal is to be a tool to enforce certain patterns that we can consider "Good practices" or just avoid errors and bad syntaxes. This is possible by using a big set of rules that are completely customizable, and with just one line you can turn on or off the rules that you prefer and of course there are a lot of custom rules made by the community that in addition to add more validation to Javascript, also makes an integration to other stuff you may have like [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-React), [TailwindCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss), [Typescript](https://typescript-eslint.io) and many more.

So Eslint is very good but why do I need the extension? Well, you can run `npx eslint .` every time to check if Eslint got any error or warning, but if you want something more fast and easy to do, and trust me, you do, [installing the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) allows Eslint to run parallel while coding, ensuring that the error will be shown as you code.

## 2. Git Lens

<Img

  name="Git Lens"
  alt="Print showing Git Lens extension"
/>

Have you ever code with a partner? A friend, co-worker or relative and found a line with a very serious bug and needed went to Github to found how made that line? Well, with Git Lens solves your problem by adding a little hint of who made the last update to that line and in how much time ago. I can tell you must be thinking. How this is so useful? For me, it can be handy to have, you may forgot the extension installed but at some time I can assure you will use. Not only for to know the person how did change the line, but also to know when was the last time that line was updated.

I know Git Lens offers other uses, but for my necessities this is good enough. You can read more about it [here](https://www.gitkraken.com/gitlens).

## 3. Editor Config

<Img

  name="Editor Config"
  alt="Print showing Editor Config extension"
/>

[Editor config](https://editorconfig.org) is a set of configurations that can maintain consistent coding across multiple IDEs, the configurations are basically about indentations, file formats, charset, unix style new lines, etc.

This extensions enables to overwrite vscode configurations with the ones set on `.editorconfig` file.

I always like to config this file instead my vscode because this way I know the code will be more consistent across multiple IDEs.

## 4. Print showing Code Snapshot extension

<Img

  name="Code Snapshot"
  alt="Print showing Code Snapshot extension"
/>

I confess that Code Snapshot is not a super must have extension, but it is really nice and works really well. It can take screenshots from your code in MacOS style for you to post anywhere you want, like in a social media.

## 5. VSCode Icons

<Img

  name="VSCode Icons"
  alt="Print showing VSCode Icons extension"
/>

This one has a lot of my opinion, but I really think you should have an extension to modify your icons. It help so much when finding that specific file, I always go for the icon first instead of the file extension or the name of it.

## 6. Import Cost

<Img

  name="Import Cost"
  alt="Print showing Import Cost extension"
/>

One of the most important thing we as developer need to understand is how our site can be found by search engines like Google or Bing, and one thing I see a lot is a very large [First Contentful Paint(FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp).
This is basically the time when the first render of page ends and this is [crucial for user experience](https://web.dev/fcp/#what-is-a-good-fcp-score), a bad time may result in user leaving your page.
One of the strategies to decrease FCP time is the only first load the necessary and after you can load the small pieces like an api call. And this can be achieved by removing all the big bundles inside your project. The [Import Cost extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) helps you to do that by showing the bundle size of that lib and then you can or remove it or search for a lighter lib.

## 7. Markdown All in One and MDX

<Img

  name="MDX extension"
  alt="Print showing MDX extension"

  name="A markdown file"
  alt="Print showing markdown file"
/>

In this topic I will put two extensions because I know not everyone is a React developer and uses [MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) files as I use, so it is more reasonable for these people use [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) that gives all the essential stuff to have a great time writing your files.
For React developers I suggest using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), a superset of Markdown allowing to use React component inside Markdown. It is super handful and as I see, MDX is becoming a popular way to write Markdown in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx). You can even use [Content layer](https://contentlayer.dev/docs/sources/files/mdx-d747e46d) to type your Markdown, if that's not fantastic I don't know what is.

## 8. Code Spell Checker

  name="Code Spell Checker"
  alt="Print showing Code Spell Checker extension"
/>

Again, if you write files Markdown or anything that will probably be useful to have a grammar corrector and this extension is just like that.

## 9. Auto Rename Tag

<Img

  name="Auto Rename Tag"
  alt="Print showing Auto Rename Tag extension"
/>

One of the most useful extension I use is Auto Rename Tag, this as the name says, when change the tag name, the matching one will be changed too.

## 10. Themes

<Img

  name="Dracula Theme"
  alt="Print showing Dracula Theme"
/>

In number 10 I will put a more vast collection of extensions used to change the VSCode appearance, of course I am talking about [themes](https://vscodethemes.com/). There are a lot and I mean A LOT of available themes that can change the most different aspects, but most likely the colors, you can find a more lighter, darker, greener, yellowish and many more themes.

If you want a recommendation, I would certain suggest to use [Dracula Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula), it is one of most famous themes out there with more than 5 million installs. The colors are great even for dark environments or bright environments.

## 11. Extra ones

Well, for last I would suggest you to install the extension useful for what you are using to code, like if you are using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), please use the [TailwindCSS extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss), and this can be applied to everything in your project, [Styled Components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=styled-components.vscode-styled-components) or even other language than Javascript like [Python](https://www.python.org) VSCode has the extension [Python for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).
So have a look what you have installed and search if has an extension that could help you. 😊

## Conclusion

Conclusion reading this article you were introduced to a set of VSCode extensions that can help improve your coding time and quality. All of that are free and can be downloaded from [Microsoft VSCode MarketPlace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com). Thank you for reading and see you in the next article. Have a nice day. 😎✨✨✨😎
