Have you ever knew that Javascript has a type `bigInt`? No? Well, now you will know everthing about all 7 primitives types in Javascript. But first what is a primitive value?

## Definifition

In Javascript, a data type is considered primitive value if immutable and is not an object and has no methods or properties. You can never change a primitive value in Javascript, for example:

```javascript
let a = 'hello'
let b = a
console.log(b) // "hello"
b.substring(2) // "llo"
console.log(b) // "hello"
console.log(a) // "hello"

let c = [3]
let d = c
c.push(1)
console.log(c) // Array [ 3, 1 ]
console.log(d) // Array [ 3, 1 ]
```

In the example above, we can never change the primitive value string **hello** no matter how many methods we do in *b*, but is not the case of array *c* and *d*, when we push item to *d*, automatically pushes to *c* too, so is mutable.

Primitives values are super important to know, independently of the language used, every one has a critical importance and usage case.

## type number

`Number` in Javascript is a primitive type that stores 64 bit numbers with double floating precision. In the docs you can find a lot more about `number`, but to simplify things, it represent numbers. We will talk more later in the article why we have 'other' ways to represent numbers and not only the `type number`. But for the most part it is related to its limitations. You see, computers cannot hold every infinite number, they have a limit, and so the programming languages. Javascript `number` that can be accessed with `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`.

```javascript
console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
// 9007199254740991

console.log(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER)
// -9007199254740991
```



## type BigInt

Most of the languages cannot store infinite numbers, Javascript is no different, the `type number`
