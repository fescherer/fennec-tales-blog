In every programming language you will find some primitives values. It's not different in JavaScript, we have 7- number, string, boolean, bigint, null, undefined and symbol. Every one having a different case usage. In this article I gonna show you every Javascript primitive values and its usage case, but first what is a primitive value?

## Definition

In Javascript, a data type is considered primitive value if immutable and is not an object and has no methods or properties. You can never change a primitive value in Javascript, for example:


```js
let a = 'hello'
let b = a
console.log(b) // "hello"

b.substring(2) // "llo"
console.log(b) // "hello"
console.log(a) // "hello"

let c = [3]
let d = c
c.push(1)
console.log(c) // Array [ 3, 1 ]
console.log(d) // Array [ 3, 1 ]
```

In the example above, we can never change the primitive value string *hello* no matter how many methods we do in *b*, but is not the case of array *c* and *d*, when we push item to *d*, automatically pushes to *c* too, so is mutable.

Primitives values are super important to know, independently of the language used, every one has a critical importance and usage case. For this reason, we're gonna explain each one that exists in JavaScript.

## type number

In JavaScript, **Number** is a primitive data type used to represent numerical values. It stores 64-bit floating-point numbers following the IEEE 754 standard, which supports double-precision. This makes it versatile for handling integers as well as decimals, and it's the primary type for representing numbers in JavaScript.

Number accepts almost all operators. An interesting fact is that JavaScript handles somethings that would be consider error in other programming languages, we will see more in the next topics.

An important aspect of numbers in JavaScript is that when you perform an operation that is not possible, such attempting invalid operations between types (like multiplying strings), the result will be *NaN*, which stands for 'Not a Number' and indicates an error in the computation.

```js
const n = 1
const n2 = 2

console.log(n + n2) // 3
console.log(n - n2) // -1
console.log(n * n2) // 2
console.log(n / n2) // 0.5
console.log(n % n2) // 1
console.log(n === n2) // false

console.log('text' * 'text') // NaN
```

## type string

A **String** is a sequence of characters used to represent text in JavaScript. It allows for the storage and manipulation of textual data, making it essential for handling words, sentences, and other character-based information. Strings have a wide range of use cases due to their versatility in representing and manipulating text, making them one of the most frequently used data types in JavaScript.

JavaScript has a particularly behavior- If you use the sum operator with some string there will be no error as would happen in other programming languages, instead JavaScript handle this by transforming the result in a string by concatenating the values.

```js
const s = '1'
const s2 = 'text'

console.log(1 + s) //  11
console.log(false + s2) // falsetext
```

## bigint

**BigInt** is used to store integers beyond JavaScript's safe integer limit (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER). While powerful for handling very large numbers, it is rarely needed in typical small-medium applications.

```js
const maxSafeNumber = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER // 9007199254740991
const beyondMaxN1 = maxSafeNumber + 1 // 9007199254740992
const beyondMaxN2 = maxSafeNumber + 2 // 9007199254740992

const bigN = 9007199254740991n
const beyondMaxBigN = 9007199254740991n + 2n // 9007199254740993n
```

## boolean

A **Boolean** is a logical data type that can only hold one of two values: *true* or *false*. It is commonly used in conditions and decision-making statements.

Those values can be represented in other forms like binary, 1 represents true and 0 represents false. This means that, in Javascript you can make operations with those values.

```js
const isDeveloper = true
const isLastType = false

console.log(true + 2) // 3
console.log(true - 2) // -1
```

## undefined

**undefined** is a default value automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not yet given a value, or to function parameters that have no corresponding arguments.

```js
let value
const value2 = undefined
```

## symbol

A **Symbol** is a unique and immutable primitive value that can be used as a key for properties in an object, ensuring property names do not conflict.

```js
const sym1 = Symbol()
const sym2 = Symbol('desc')
const sym3 = Symbol('desc')

console.log(sym2 === sym3) // false
```

## null

A **null** value represents a reference that intentionally points to a nonexistent or invalid object or address, indicating the absence of any value.

In operations, you can treat null as 0 since many calculations can be performed by substituting null with 0 without affecting the outcome.

```js
const value = null

console.log(2 + null) // 2
console.log(2 * null) // 2
```

In this article we saw all the primitive data types that exists in JavaScript. This article was short, but I hope you like it. Have a nice day.  ðŸ˜Žâœ¨âœ¨âœ¨ðŸ˜Ž
