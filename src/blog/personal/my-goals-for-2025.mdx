2024 was a very nice year for me. I did so many things that I am very proud, and 2025 promises a lot. This is a very short essay about 2024 and what I expect about 2025.

## Review of my 2024

I always was very organized about the things I did and want to do, but 2024 was a special year for my organization process. I began to document almost everything about it. So looking now, I have a lot of notes I want to share with you.

In this year I got to travel with my brother to a city not so far from where I live, but this was my first travel driving relative far. So we went to Holambra, State of SÃ£o Paulo- Brazil, this city is known for its flowers and festivals in September, I know we got a little late (In January), but the city was very beautiful and we got to taste flower ice cream. This city was built by the Dutch, which is why it is very similar to the Netherlands, including having the largest mill in Latin America (It doesn't work, but it serves as a tourist attraction).

I also got to know a lot of places with my girlfriend, we both started new jobs more flexible and got a lot of free time to spend together. With this free time I also got to help my parents in their local cafeteria located in the main park of the city. This year was very hot and this is specially good for places like parks, so we never got to work like this year, it is a good, but also we never had a free weekend in the whole year. As you may know, I started some projects specially related to gaming development.

In the last months, I discovered some toys I had stored in my room, called Gogo's Crazy Bones, and decided to complete the collection. So I searched in the whole internet about them, and realized they have many collections though the year, so I started to gather information and searching in the Facebook Market Place for those toys. If you wanna see my collection, I started a Instagram and Facebook page (Soon I will also have a Youtube Channel)

## My goals for 2025

I hope 2025 will be even better than 2024. I'm known as one of those people who has 30 million projects, so I never have time to make them. But this year will be different. I am breaking down all of them to smaller projects so I can deliver fast. One of my goals is to create at least 2 web project per month, with my big project list in Notion,
there was no shortage of ideas. Maybe one day I will share with you or make a article about simple project portfolio ideas.

This year I hope to finish my Gogo's Crazy Bones collection, well, at least the Brazilian collections which includes: Geloucos, Geloucos Rockeiros, Gelo-CÃ³smicos, GogoToys, Gogo Fantasmas, Gogo Urban Toys, Gogo Megatrip, Futgogo, Gogo Disney 1 and 2. There is also the Dragon Ball Z Gogo's, I have some of them, but they are not that great and also very rare and expensive, so I am not in a hurry about them. Yes, a lot of collections, but all of them is almost completed, I think the Gogo Disney 2 is the one that I have the fewer, which is half of them. As said before, I would like to create a Youtube Channel to show all the collection, so be aware, Fennec Tales Collections will be soon created.

I also want to a least create a steam page for a game. I don't know if I can develop the whole game in my free time this year, but I will try show as much as possible for you. I cannot say anything to you because I am still planning the base game, but you can expect a kinda roguelite game.

Finally, in my personal life I want to start Muay Thai with my brother and also stay in the gym as I am right now. I also wanted to clean my portfolio in the social medias, to maybe get a better job.

Thank you for reading this article and as always, see you in the next article ðŸ˜‰ Bye!
