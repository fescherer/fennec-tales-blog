A story about my journey through a new challenge- Game Off 2024. We gonna tell everything that we made to achieve our final product. Everyday updating with the news. Stay tunned! ðŸ˜Š

## Day 01 - 02

Those firsts days were reserved for planning the game. We had already thought about which game style would like, even before the game had started. So we take those days to     refine the idea and change little things to fit the theme - SECRETS.
The game will be a manager clicker, where player would need to create recipes given by NPCs, very basic, but we need to think that we only have one month and have to do everything from graphic assets to song and music assets. This will be hard, but we are surly will be fun.
