A story about my journey through a new challenge- Game Off 2024. We gonna tell everything that we made to achieve our final product. Everyday updating with the news. Stay tunned! ðŸ˜Š

## Day 01 - 02

Those firsts days were reserved for planning the game. We had already thought about which game style would like, even before the game had started. So we take those days to     refine the idea and change little things to fit the theme - SECRETS.
The game will be a manager clicker, where player would need to create recipes given by NPCs, very basic, but we need to think that we only have one month and have to do everything from graphic assets to song and music assets. This will be hard, but we are surly will be fun.

## Day 03 - 04

After deciding which style the game will have, I finally started creating the project on Unreal and setting the camera. As I said before, the game will be like a clicker, so I had two options to make- First would create the full game as widgets in Unreal which would limit me a little bit in what I want to do, well, the second option would create the game in a top-down like perspective and make the character invisible, so would looks like those manager game, like Cities Skyline and other city building.

## Day 05

This day was more easy, I started to make some main assets, but quickly realize that somethings will not be possible or too difficult for me to handle in this short time, so I changed some plans and started smaller.

## Day 06

I finally started to add the main game, so created a button blueprint that I want to change some text in the ui if pressed. I add a function to search for objects when right click is clicked and then change the widget UI created before
